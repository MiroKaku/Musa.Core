name: Build

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    # The branches below must be a subset of the branches above
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  Build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: windows-2022

    # Any commit that contains [build] will now trigger these jobs, everything else will be skipped.
